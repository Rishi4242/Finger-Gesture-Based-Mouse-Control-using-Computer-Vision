# Finger-Gesture-Based-Mouse-Control-using-Computer-Vision

# Description:

# Developed a virtual mouse system using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe to control the cursor and perform click actions through hand gestures.

# Implemented real-time hand landmark detection to track index and thumb finger positions for movement and click gestures.

# Integrated PyAutoGUI to map finger coordinates to screen dimensions, enabling smooth and responsive cursor control.

# Enabled single-hand control with fingertip distance measurement to trigger mouse clicks, enhancing accessibility and touchless interaction.
